# Javascript Rumble!
A basic web game designed to teach jQuery and javascript

## Step 1
Familiarize yourself with the existing code and make sure you understand how it is working. Make sure you load the index.html page into your browser and see how it looks so far.

Finish filling in the remaining HTML, CSS and jQuery to make the game run.

You must decide what the players' characters will look like and how they will move.

You can decide to move them automatically or have them move on key press to give the game some skill.

## Step 2
Expand on the basic game and add more awesome functionality.

Have you tried using images for the characters' appearances?

Did you create javascript objects to give your characters different skills/stats?
